# Show Me The Money - Balance Sheet Application

This application displays a balance sheet report using React for the frontend and Express for the backend.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Running the Application

1. Build and start the containers: `docker-compose up --build`

2. Access the application:
- Frontend: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: The API will be available at `http://localhost:4001`

3. `docker-compose down` to stop the application

The application consists of three parts:

1. Frontend (React): Runs on port 3001
2. Backend (Express): Runs on port 4001
3. Mock API: Runs on port 3000


## Frontend
- Application is built using React + TypeScript
- The frontend is a single page application that displays a balance sheet report
- The report is displayed in a table format
- The report is generated by calling the backend API
- There's a shared components that handle the loading and toast messages(for errors)
- The `BalanceSheetReport.tsx` component houses the main logic for fetching the data and displaying the report, it also handles the error and loading states of the application. 
    - the logic to render the report is broken up with functions to handle the different sections of the report
- unit tests added to test the rendering of the report and the error handling
- There is a service that handles the API call to the backend
- The application is styled using Tailwind CSS
- The application is responsive and works on mobile devices
- if the API call fails, the application will display an error message and a button to retry the API call

## Backend
- The Express server with Typescript is set up in `index.ts`, which applies CORS middleware and sets up the routes.
- When a request is made to `/api/v1/balance-sheet`, it's routed to the `fetchBalanceSheet` function in `balanceSheetController.ts`.
- The controller calls the `getBalanceSheet` function from `balanceSheetService.ts`.
- The service makes an HTTP GET request to the external API using Axios to fetch the balance sheet data.
- The data is then returned to the client as a JSON response.
- The server is set up to run on port 4001.
- unit tests added to test the controller and service functions



## Process:
- I started by setting up the frontend and backend applications separately in the same repository for accessibility 
- My main concern was to put together the backend quickly so I could focus on the frontend
- With the frontend I worked through the structure of the data and how to display it in a table format
- I could have moved the table data into a separate component but I felt it was simple enough to keep it in the main component and could complicate things if I moved it
- I added the error handling and loading states to the application
- I added the service to handle the API call
- I added the tests for the frontend
- I then moved onto the backend and set up the Express server and the routes
